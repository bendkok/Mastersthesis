Had to increase precision for some of the experiments because I got 0 RE.
Should I rerun all of them with higher precision?
	Done.

I've used both aux and BC in the text, but only BC in the plots. I think aux might be better, so I might change that.

Need to update the varchange plots to not have Inff. but Inf. Or something else.
	Done.
Need to also actually do practical identifiability analysis.
	Done.

Make bar plot not have MRE when there's only one RE.
	Done.

Change titles for multi-plots. Include states, remove h.p.
	Done.

I've used Ï„ in both FHN and in ode loss. Need a good alternative. 
Can use t^o and t^d for example.
	Used \mathcal{T} for ode loss.

I think I've accidentally run the just v experiments with v and w...
	Fixed.


Don't have p.i. as error bars.
Run every experiment with the same number of epochs.
Could write about how the noise was applied.
Could remove MRE fomr bar-plots. Can mention it in the text.

Make it clear that the results are good, but that it took a lot of tuning as well.
Can have bad results in the appendix.
Can remove title from plots, instead write in caption.

Make a script that recreates the figures used in text.
Can change NN and ODE plots to be three lines in the same plot.
Also plot the diff. between true value, and NN and ODE.


Looking at HH-model could be useful. 

Can mention hiPSC, but not too important.
Can be used for drug screening, etc.
Write some about these applications.
