Had to increase precision for some of the experiments because I got 0 RE.
Should I rerun all of them with higher precision?

I've used both aux and BC in the text, but only BC in the plots. I think aux might be better, so I might change that.

Need to update the varchange plots to not have Inff. but Inf. Or something else.
Need to also actually do practical identifiability analysis.

Make bar plot not have MRE when there's only one RE.

Change titles for multi-plots. Include states, remove h.p.
