Relative error, abs(differnce)/true value
	take mean of that
use table or historgam plot
might do several runs, take mean + variance
	barplot error bars

something about why models are important/useful
+ some refrences
look at other thesis for inspiration
can still focus on ML part
a section about DeepXDE

needs to find external sensor
I should ask the addministration about organizing the defence/finding external advisor

might find good/high level explenation of identifiability in a text book or something
seacrh lecture notes identifiability
masters thesis maybe


for experiments focus on importance of input/feature transform
can make a list of hyperpara that can be tuned 

need to fix var change plots
look at what plots different papers have


scailing time in f.t., several features, running for longer

can see how well the model fits outside the timedomain
can be a disscussion in the thesis
can we just use the nn?

discussion about wheights


try to finnish writing about fhn results by the end of March
