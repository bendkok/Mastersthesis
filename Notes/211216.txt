Tried running code a bunch of times. Getting meh results.

Found lr is quite important.
The code seems to get stuck in some local minima, leading to bad results after a few epochs.
It seems like the nn quite easily finds the first and last points.
It also cuts of if any periods become larger than the final point.

Maybe trying to change one of the bc will help? Or making that one not important at all.
Making the weight quite small didn't seem to help.
Changing bc didn't seem to help either.

Tried changing nn-structure.
Didn't seem to do much.

Use He instead of Golrot, better for ReLu and probably swish.


Look into output scailing. Why was that done again?
Do they actually do any input scaling? I can't find it.
They claim to do input transformation, but nothing in the code is equivalent to inp tran.
Line 43, why?

Adding manual input scailing only made it worse.

Different activation functions didn't work.
Changing output transform to have sin didn't work.
first_num_epochs dosen't seem to do much.
lr dosen't seem to do much, other than say how many epochs we need.
Changing nn-structure didn't seem to work.
