At begining of thesis compare with current models, both accuracy and compute time
	try a bit of grid search, see the time and extrapolate to say 1e11
	grid search might be to coarse for this model, also very slow
	gradient descent might get stuck in local minima
	maybe gentic alogotithms
	global optimization methods
	nn and sgd hopefully won't
adaptive weight?
is the nn prediction periodic or is it just the visualisation?
could the frequency be learned?
explain the model, show how the model changes with different parameters
talk about stiffness
state how we achived the frequency
the thesis shouldn't be a story of how I acchived the endpoint, start more from simple problem and then say if this works we can make it more complicated.
present more result
try feature transform with only the sin, no t
stiffness is probably handled in the output transform
maybe not focus on the output transform
would expect to have a perfect fit on the nn-prediction
	focus on that
mention that fhn is stiff in the thesis, cite relevant papers, but not much more
data loss and ode loss seem to be competing, which shouldn't happen. Maybe something wrong in the code?
do a run, act like I try to give myself tips for where to go next/change
we use the old version of deepxde, shouldn't be a problem
try no test maybe
