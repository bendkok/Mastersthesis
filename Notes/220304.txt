How does Figure 7 in sbinn2 limit the search range of parameters?

Should I have an explenation of how the algorithm for finding identifiability works?
How should I include a citation to text books?
Need to ask about citations for sec. 2.2.
How to use citations when it's information I remember about a topic, and not from a specific source?
Loss or cost?


Changed t to t/999 in do_t_input_transform. Seems to have helped. I think it's because of input scaling.


identifiability 


Parameter ranges




Try with b, both, noise
have some assesment of feature transform
number of epochs was critical for making it work
Is t in feature transform needed?
do BR at the end if there's time
need to define e.g. lr before I use the term

include nr. 32
discuss a bit about which feature transforms are important
what happens with bad ft, etc.

can do own analysis of fhn-variables



Maybe say that model can refeer to different things.
legg inn noise % i plottet.
Need to explain/make clear what a good result and a bad result will look like.


var = tf.Variable(0, trainable=True, dtype=tf.float32) didn't seem to work well with fitting all FHN.
Due to divide by zero. 1e-10 didn't work. Does 1e-4 work?
Kinda works. A different startpoint might be better.

How much shuold I wirte about physiology vs. ML?
Should I explain what a capacitor is?
