cut at the beginning, used 20min should be 10min
controll hands better (do less with them)
some slides had too much whitespace
keep font size more consistent
more images in the begining
slide 4: can skip the current title, use the bullet point as title
at fhn: show specific formula when explaining cubic…
sgd
at NN explain C
explain all parameters in the functions
more focused, less abstract (p->a,b,τ,I)
remember to mention partial data
at identifiability, have example?
    maybe the result?

introduce myself
logo of Simula/UiO
add slide numbers
beginning I say everything in 2 min in start then 10min later
    can be skipped
for ML relate more to out specific case
separate loss/optimization/lr
+ more figures
try to link more to our problem
NN explain all in formula
show figure of non-convexity
show better where the NN is in the PINN
historical, maybe have table of pors/cons
PINN loss: motivate why the different terms
better explain length, e.g. x in S, y in M, s>=M
relate more to our problem/specific case
either shorter outline or more transition slides
    can bold the specific section in the outline
or maybe on the bottom
use latex consistently for functions/variables/etc.
evaluation can be skipped
instead explain next to specific results
four the for figure slides, explain one each figure first time
Importance slide, too many figures
animate the introduction of the figures
explain everything on the slides
missing acknowledgment page

don’t have entire thesis
maybe just tell a story instead
maybe not all the background at first
have more flexibility in how the info is presented
think more about how I transition between sections
phsyi to ML: missing some context from the intro or better transition
first slide more graphics/less or no text
more about why we model cells in general
“use synthetic data so we can see the error in the parameter estimation”
there are various different ion channels in a cell model, a simple rep. is on that open/closes based upon the balance of the potential
w - double u
for plots have smaller timescale (500ms?)
for FHN: only one plot, only a couple of beats
for loss/opti: more general overview of what happens in ML first
for PINN: show simple graphical representation
e.g. full structure of PINN shown later (show earlier)
identifiability:
    title be a full sentence
    combine all three into one slide
    show one example
for the inferred values have lines representing the nominal values
for extrapolating, mention why it is bad or remove/show how it can be explored further
limitations can maybe removed
or combine with future work
