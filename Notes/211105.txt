Try minibatches
	We realised that there weren't any use of minibatching in the simulation. Minibatching can more quickly approach of the optimal values, and is thus generally better to use.
Try making plot of gradients.
	Will make it easier to see if the functions converge correctly.
Reread papers, try to find the tricks they use in the code.
Output transform might be more important than what we've considered.
Make plots of lambdas.
Split loss plot.
Maybe try different optimizer alghorithms?
Read about adam.
Look at lr and nn-structure later.
Write down what I'm doing and why.
