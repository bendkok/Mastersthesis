I think we use all the time points from data_t for the ODE time points, $\tau_{n}$. Might be worth looking into.
Should also look more into the output transformation.
I can't find the input-scaling layer anywhere in the code.
Need good source for AD.
How do you handle where to place citations while writing? Or do you do it afterwards?
I'm also a bit usure if what I'm writing is too similar to the source.
Should probably include something about notation.



Consider if I should test another model.
Beeler Reuter maybe?
Might include some citations to books.
Look at cited by at google scholar.
Better to write more, and then remove later.
Write about the history in the end.
Try to think of the paper as a story.
In classic NN you wouldn't have ode and aux loss terms. Talk about why those are introduced.
