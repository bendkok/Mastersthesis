Wrote some more on understandingcode document, about the loss functions.

Tried different scaling functions, all of them were worse.
Some gave bad results (gaussian, sigmois), some just gave nan (tanh).
In glucose_insulin they use tanh, but they also have f.exs. v * 10 + 290. That might be something to try out.

Tried to visualize the output with and without feature_transform. You need to use build() for the feature transform to take effect.
Didn't have much success here, but got something.

Maybe nested k-fold?
