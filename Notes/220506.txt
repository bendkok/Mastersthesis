what from the feedback should I focus on?

figures
what sort of license does thesis use? e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_potential#/media/File:Action_potential_vert.png

Nernst necessary?
title still fine?
how is the notation?
formulation in introduction
colors of links and such
additional figures and tables. Should more be moved there? Should it be removed? 
remove BR? or expand on
certain parts too technical

a bit unsure on the whole gentic algo. thing
brute force paper/ what's actually been shown?

\textit{loss} function or \textit{loss function}?

extra titles/subtitles 
	cells in general
	supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
	Train and test data
	Gradient descent
	Remove PINN
	Expand Summary of Hyperparameters
	

maybe have a section before PINN using e.g. sgd, see what happens, has problems
why we extend the loss function



Want feedback on:
- figures in physiology
- identifiability section
small changes:
- parts where you've written "rewrite this" - AD, regression in introduction, 
- abstract
- introduction
- conclusion (limited feedback from before)
