How much should I have to change glycolysis.py and fitzhugh_nagumo.py?
Simply changing function for y dosen't work. Need to change pinn-function too.
	Boundary conditions?
	Observes?
Tried chaning pinn() manually, encountered some problems. Line 146 gives:
RuntimeError: DirichletBC should output 1D values. Use argument 'component' for different components.

output_dir in saveplot()?
How does model_restore_path work?
